# Access

## Overview

**Access** is a web-based project designed to create an interactive experience involving sequences, combinations, and validation mechanics. The primary purpose is to offer a challenge to users by requiring them to solve puzzles, such as entering correct sequences or combinations to unlock content.

## Features

- **Interactive Locks**: Users must enter the correct combination to unlock certain pages.
- **Sequence Validation**: The site checks specific sequences and validates them against pre-defined correct answers.
- **Dynamic Feedback**: The site provides feedback to users depending on their input, guiding them through the challenge.

## Project Structure

The project is structured into several key parts:

- **HTML Pages**: The core of the project, including `TheLock.html` and other similar pages that users interact with.
- **CSS Styles**: Custom styles to give the site a distinct look and feel, particularly with glowing effects for interactive elements.
- **JavaScript**: Scripts that handle user interactions, validate input, and manage navigation between pages.

## How to Use

1. **Visit the Site**: Navigate to the project and start by interacting with the elements presented, such as entering digits in the lock.
2. **Solve Puzzles**: Each page will have a specific challenge, like entering a correct sequence or combination.
3. **Unlock Content**: Correct answers will allow you to navigate to the next page or reveal hidden content.

## Technical Details

- **JavaScript**: Custom scripts are written to handle user interactions and validate input.
- **CSS Animations**: Smooth transitions and glowing effects are applied to enhance the user experience.
- **HTML Structure**: Clear and semantic HTML is used to structure the content.
